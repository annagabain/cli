# cli The Command-Line Interface

This is our first look at the command-line interface. The command-line interface is the lowest level interface that we have with a computer, and can accomplish all of the things that we would normally do with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and much more!

## Technologies Used

In this project we used the terminal to execute some commands to move around the file system and create, modify and delete files and folders.

Here is my *Working With Files and Folders* challenge solution


**Challenge**

Let's practice our new skills by creating and organising a new folder in a Gitpod workspace. To complete the challenge you need to create and organise the folder from the command line only! Here are the steps you need to follow:

Run a command to create a new folder called codingLanguages in your workspace
Run a command to create a new file called html.txt in your workspace
Run a command to create a new file called css.txt in your workspace
Run a command to move the html.txt file from your workspace to your codingLanguages folder
Run a command to copy the css.txt file from your workspace to your codingLanguages folder
Delete your codingLanguages folder
If you have completed the challenge by running the correct commands, you should be left with a single file in your workspace called css.txt
