# cli The Command-Line Interface

This is our first look at the command-line interface. The command-line interface is the lowest level interface that we have with a computer, and can accomplish all of the things that we would normally do with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and much more!

## Technologies Used

In this project we used the terminal to execute some commands to move around the file system and create, modify and delete files and folders.

Here is my *Working With Files and Folders* challenge solution


**Challenge**

Let's practice our new skills by creating and organising a new folder in a Gitpod workspace. To complete the challenge you need to create and organise the folder from the command line only! Here are the steps you need to follow:

-Run a command to create a new folder called codingLanguages in your workspace
-Run a command to create a new file called html.txt in your workspace
-Run a command to create a new file called css.txt in your workspace
-Run a command to move the html.txt file from your workspace to your codingLanguages folder
-Run a command to copy the css.txt file from your workspace to your codingLanguages folder
-Delete your codingLanguages folder
-If you have completed the challenge by running the correct commands, you should be left with a single file in your workspace called css.txt
